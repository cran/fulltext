Although characteristic proteins of the plasma membrane, namely the β1‐adrenoreceptor and Gαi, were stained by monoclonal antibodies in the hypercontracted cells, these proteins could not be detected in the adjacent blebs. Monoclonal antibodies to the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), calsequestrin and SERCA2 bound at different amounts to surface components of the blebs and to components of the hypercontracted cells. From the immunofluorescence signals we conclude that the blebs are mainly constituted of corbular and junctional SR membrane, and only to a lesser extent of network SR membrane. Deconvolution microscopy revealed that the membrane location of RyR2, calsequestrin and SERCA2 in the bleb is comparable to native SR membrane. At the bleb membrane giga‐ohm seals could be obtained and patches could be excised in a way that single‐channel currents could be measured, although these are not completely identified.</p></abstract></abstractGroup></contentMeta></header><body sectionsNumbered="yes" xml:id="feb2s0014579301028629-body-0001"><section xml:id="feb2s0014579301028629-sec-1"><label>1</label><title type="main">Introduction</title><p>Contraction in heart muscle is triggered mainly by Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB1">[1]</link>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the cardiomyocyte through L‐type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, located both in the surface and the T‐tubular membrane, triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptor channels (RyR2), representing the main isoform of this protein in heart muscle.</p><p>While for electrophysiological characterization the L‐type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is directly accessible to patch‐clamp recordings, channel proteins as RyR2 located in intracellular membranes are not. Thus, lipid bilayers made of e.g. phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine serve as artificial membranes, in which after purification RyR2 is incorporated by spontaneous reconstitution. With two purification methods several electrophysiological investigations have been performed on RyR2 <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB2 #feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB3 #feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB4 #feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB5">[2–5]</link>. In method 1 SR membrane vesicles containing RyR2 are biochemically purified in several steps. In method 2 the subfractions of the SR membrane are further purified and finally RyR2 is isolated. Since method 1 is closer to native conditions than method 2, electrophysiological results from SR membrane vesicles are assumed to be comparable with the in situ situation, an assumption that has not yet been verified.</p><p>Results on RyR2 are mainly from experiments with cardiac tissue obtained from various animals <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB4 #feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB6">[4,6]</link>. In experiments on RyR2 with diseased human heart tissue Holmberg et al. <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB7">[7]</link> used method 1 and found no differences in the channel characteristics compared to normal animal tissue. In both methods the purification process probably causes alteration of physiological and pathophysiological functions of RyR2 <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB8">[8]</link>. This may be due to changes of the native lipid environment, when incorporation into an artificial bilayer for electrophysiological experiments is necessary. Furthermore, regulatory and accessory proteins <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB9">[9]</link>, e.g. FKBP12, sorcin, calmodulin, calsequestrin, junctin, and triadin, may be altered.</p><p>More than a decade ago Stein and Palade <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB10">[10]</link> developed a technique, which allows for measurements of the native skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. Subsequently with this method various membrane proteins of skeletal muscle SR were characterized electrophysiologically <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB11 #feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB12 #feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB13 #feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB14">[11–14]</link>.

Then the cells were superfused with PSS with addition of 0.2 mg/ml saponin. This was the four‐fold concentration used by Endo and Iino <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB17">[17]</link> in skeletal muscle fibers to preserve SR function while perforating the surface membrane. At this stage of the experiment the cells were carefully observed on a monitor by means of a camera, which was connected to the side tube of an inverted microscope. Presumably reflecting perforation by saponin, first the thickness of the plasma membrane seemed to diminish. Then the regular cross striation of the cell began to dissolve, probably as a consequence of local increase of internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. During the time interval of 10–30 min following the addition of saponin a first contraction of the cell was observed. In order to preserve the SR membrane a prompt switching to saponin‐free PSS was essential at this moment. During the following 10 min local contractions occurred, subsequently becoming more frequent and synchronous, then spreading over the whole cell in a wave‐like fashion, and finally resulting in a hypercontraction of the myocyte. Just at the moment of maximum hypercontraction about 3–10 SR membrane blebs originated through the perforated surface membrane.</p></section><section xml:id="feb2s0014579301028629-sec-2.4"><label>2.4</label><title type="main">Immunohistochemistry</title><p>After induction of membrane blebs cardiomyocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate‐buffered saline for 30 min.

A band‐pass filter CY3 (AHF) without overlap in the fluorescence emission spectrum was utilized. Each specimen was acquired as an image stack with 64 planes. The distances of the image planes were set to 100 nm to assure proper oversampling of the optical resolution for the subsequent iterative deconvolution process. Both theoretical point‐spread functions (PSF), based on microscope and specimen data, and measured PSF, calculated from fluorescent beads with a diameter of 1 μm (Molecular Probes, T‐14792), were used.

Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical stainings for different plasma membrane and SR membrane proteins. Microscopical investigation of the immunofluorescence‐stained cardiomyocytes gives evidence of an SR origin of the blebs (<link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-FIG2">Fig. 2</link>). Especially for RyR2 (<link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-FIG2">Fig. 2A</link>) and calsequestrin (<link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-FIG2">Fig. 2B</link>) intense labeling of the blebs was visible, which was often stronger compared to the staining seen in the adjacent and fully contracted cardiomyocytes.

Hence binding to membrane structures in the blebs could be discriminated from other binding. The deconvolution images reveal differences in the distribution of RyR2, calsequestrin and SERCA2 in the cardiomyocytes versus their adjacent blebs.

The blebs were studied by using vital, immunofluorescence and high‐resolution deconvolution microscopy, as well as single‐channel patch‐clamping.</p><p>While the β1‐adrenoreceptor and Gαi could not be detected in the blebs by monoclonal antibodies, RyR2, calsequestrin, and SERCA2 were present at different amounts. In the native cell RyR2 and calsequestrin are found in the junctional and the corbular SR, while SERCA2 is found in the network SR. Thus, the immunohistochemical stainings reveal that (1) proteins of the plasma membrane are not found in the blebs, (2) proteins of the SR membrane are found in the blebs, and (3) in the bleb membrane the portion of junctional and corbular SR is higher than of network SR.</p><p>The fact that the blebs consist mainly of membranes of the junctional and the corbular SR seems plausible. Being in close proximity of the perforated plasma membrane, these portions of SR are presumably pressed out more easily upon hypercontraction of the cell than the network SR being twisted between the myofilaments.</p><p>Possible differences in SR of human atrial cells and guinea‐pig ventricular cells have to be discussed. In both types, the SR is a heterogeneous intracellular organelle, which is composed of junctional, network and corbular SR. Since atrial cells are devoid of T‐tubules, junctional SR in these is connected only to the surface membrane. While it is assumed that mechanically skinned cardiac muscle cells <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB20">[20]</link> have no junctional SR <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB21">[21]</link>, no information is available about junctional SR in our two types of saponin‐perforated cardiomyocytes. Since both the time course of SR membrane bleb formation and the bleb appearance were indistinguishable between human atrial and guinea‐pig ventricular cells, we conclude that blebs are of the same origin in both types of cells.</p><p>Deconvolution microscopy reveals that the antibodies against SR membrane proteins bound to surface components but not to the inside of the blebs. The serial sections suggest that RyR2 and SERCA2 are found in the bleb membrane and calsequestrin is found beneath the bleb membrane, like in native SR. In summary it is concluded that (1) blebs are surrounded by a single membrane, and (2) the location of the three SR proteins in this bleb membrane is similar to their in situ positions.</p><p>Point 1 is in contrast to results of Lewis et al. <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB22">[22]</link> about SR membrane blebs of skeletal muscle cells. These investigators detected a foam‐like structure inside of such kind of blebs, which were obtained after mechanical skinning of the cells. One striking difference between cells from skeletal muscle tissue and cardiac tissue is that no corbular SR is found in the former <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB21">[21]</link>. Nevertheless, this is unlikely the underlying reason for the obvious difference in the constitution of the blebs. The method of mechanical skinning is more likely to destroy connections between surface membrane, T‐tubules, and junctional SR, resulting in numerous membrane fragments, which might be found inside of the blebs after membrane fusion as the ultra‐structural correlate of these foam‐like structures.</p><p>Point 2 leads to the hopeful assumption that in cardiac SR membrane blebs accessory proteins, e.g. FKBP12, sorcin, and calmodulin on the cytosolic side such as calsequestrin, junctin, and triadin on the lumenal side, which presumably all regulate RyR2 are not disturbed in their physiological function and cooperation with RyR2 <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB9">[9]</link>. This is especially important when considering that pathophysiological defects, e.g. in heart failure, might be triggered by incomplete functional cooperation of RyR2 with accessory proteins <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB23">[23]</link>.</p><p>The patch‐clamp recordings reveal that at the bleb membrane, formation of giga‐ohm seals, excision of the patch, and single‐channel recording are possible. We used excised patches, because the concentration of different ions inside of the bleb is unknown. At the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (symmetrical 52.5 mM) used in the present study from bilayer experiments the single‐channel conductance of RyR2 is expected to be around 100–120 pS with the channel being mostly closed due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent inactivation. From our present recordings it is not possible to determine whether the single‐channel currents are being carried by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, gluconate<sup>−</sup> or Cl<sup>−</sup>. For this purpose experiments need to be performed in asymmetric ionic solutions to determine the current's reversal potential and to obtain the <i>P</i><sub>Ca</sub>/<i>P</i><sub>anion</sub> ratio.</p><p>Both short openings, the amplitude of which was cut off by the filter (1 kHz), and long openings, lasting for the whole pulse duration of 500 ms, were observed. This is similar to results from ryanodine receptors in excised patches of blebs of skeletal muscle SR <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB10">[10]</link>, which were recorded in a solution of identical ion composition. Different to those results is the main conductance level of about 65 pS in our recordings, which is near a major single‐channel subconductance level (78 pS) of the measurements of Stein and Palade <link href="#feb2s0014579301028629-bib-BIB10">[10]</link>. If the channel in our measurements can be confirmed to be RyR2, a possible reason for a subconductance level might be the type of tissue we used, namely atrial cells of patients suffering from coronary heart disease. We are going to investigate this rather interesting result in further experiments.</p><p>Our method should enable other groups, which are interested in various cardiac SR membrane proteins, to perform experiments on real native cardiac SR membrane.</p></section><section xml:id="feb2s0014579301028629-sec-0000" type="acknowledgments" numbered="no"><title type="main">Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Mrs. Iris Berg and Mrs. Mojgan Gihlav for their excellent technical assistance and Prof. DeVivie (Department of Cardiac Surgery, University of Cologne) and his colleagues for providing the myocardial tissue.

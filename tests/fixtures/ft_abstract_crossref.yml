        ecologists have long acknowledged the links between knowledge and power. Recently
        there has also been a growing interest in detailed studies about knowledge
        production within critical political ecology. This article is a study of the
        use of photographs in scientific articles on dryland ecology, and investigates
        the functions of photographs. Contrary to the straightforward manner in which
        they are presented, photographs are not value-free documentary proofs of ''how
        things are.'' Rather, photographs constitute arguments in their own right.
        Using photographic and textual theory, this study analyzes two articles that
        include photographs of fence-line contrasts between two different management
        regimes. Contrasting areas divided by a fence-line is a methodology that demonstrates
        how management differences lead to differences in vegetation. In a Southern
        African context, however, differences across a fence tend to encompass deep
        racial and economic divides, and the fence-line photos risk encompassing these
        differences. This article argues that the fence-line contrast photographs
        in this study function as models that order the causal links between vegetation
        dynamics, land tenure and land management. These models correspond closely
        to equilibrium models in range ecology, and the fence-line photographs thus
        contribute to a degradation narrative that has been influential for land reform
        policies in Southern Africa, and that feeds into land use policies that favor
        private land ownership in communal areas.Keywords: Critical political ecology,

        waste is the loss of perfectly edible food products. It is a wide-ranging

        research (TDR) is widely regarded as a promising, and even essential, means
        of addressing complex sustainability problems, whilst delivering beneficial
        outcomes for scientists and the non-academic actors with whom they engage.
        Premised on the ''ecological modernisation'' of Europe, regional funding for
        TDR under Framework Programmes such as FP7 and more recently Horizon 2020
        have sought to support academic engagement with a wide range of research stakeholders
        through calls for transdisciplinary research \u00a0in order to better address
        Europe''s \"grand societal challenges\" (EC 2013). This article, based on
        doctoral research, consists of an ex-post study of three European Union funded
        transdisciplinary projects (CREPE, EJOLT and GAP2) implemented under the Seventh
        Framework''s (2007-2013) Science in Society program. Its focus is on how issues
        of power and governance permeate TDR projects, giving rise to tensions, challenges
        and ultimately struggles over the very meaning of official projects and their
        outcomes, despite the most egalitarian of intentions and underlying principles
        of mutual benefit. These tensions, this article argues, should be understood
        not merely as cultural, methodological or cognitive challenges, but as essentially
        political conflicts that manifest and flow across multiple scales. In light
        of these inherent challenges, the article argues that TDR is always conducted
        on a terrain of political ecology, and concludes by making recommendations
        for potential collaborators, as well as for European research policy makers,
        with the objective of enabling participants and funders alike to realise the

        of the manifestations of political economy and ecology in the \"problem\"

        to engage with ethnic studies literature on coloniality, and indigenous perspectives
        on intergenerational trauma and healing. Drawing on historic and contemporary
        examples of Maidu governance and resource development in the Maidu homeland,
        California, USA, I extend the concept of intergenerational trauma in Native
        American communities from the individual and ethnic group levels to include
        the community''s relationship with the land, and the concept of itself as
        a sovereign civic, governing body. I place specific manifestations of trauma,
        de-colonizing, and healing, as exemplified by Maidu natural resource activism,
        in dialogue with political ecology approaches to better understand the relationships
        between historically colonized people, governance, and land. I argue that
        the relationships between people and resources that political ecology focuses
        on cannot be adequately understood in historically colonized communities dealing
        with neo-colonial resource and political policies, without attention to perspectives
        on coloniality\/de-coloniality, and trauma\/healing. These perspectives come

        relationships involving species richness may be unimodal, monotonically increasing,
        monotonically decreasing, bimodal, multimodal, U-shaped, or with no discernable

        suggest dynamic, nonequilibrium community processes. For that reason, they
        are also contentious. In this paper, we provide a wide-ranging review of the
        literature on unimodal (humpbacked) species richness-relationships. Though
        not as widespread as previously thought, unimodal patterns of species richness
        are often associated with disturbance, predation and herbivory, productivity,
        spatial heterogeneity, environmental gradients, time, and latitude. These
        unimodal patterns are contingent on organism and environment; we examine unimodal
        species richness-curves involving plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, plankton,
        and microbes in marine, lacustrine, and terrestrial habitats. A goal of future
        research is to understand the contingent patterns and the complex, interacting

        general diversity pattern of the Caribbean anole radiation has been described
        in detail; however, the actual mechanisms at the origin of their diversification
        remain controversial. In particular, the role of ecological speciation, and
        the relative importance of divergence in allopatry and in parapatry, is debated.
        We describe the genetic structure of anole populations across lineage contact
        zones and ecotones to investigate the effect of allopatric divergence, natural
        selection, and the combination of both factors on population differentiation.
        Allopatric divergence had no significant impact on differentiation across
        the lineage boundary, while a clear bimodality in genetic and morphological
        characters was observed across an ecotone within a single lineage. Critically,
        the strongest differentiation was observed when allopatry and ecology act
        together, leading to a sharp reduction in gene flow between two lineages inhabiting
        different habitats. We suggest that, for Caribbean anoles to reach full speciation,
        a synergistic combination of several historical and ecological factors may
        be requisite.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2012\/273413","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,2,8]],"date-time":"2012-02-08T21:01:18Z","timestamp":1328734878000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Synergy

        such discussion. However, environmental damage may also be caused by peacetime

        ecologists have long acknowledged the links between knowledge and power. Recently
        there has also been a growing interest in detailed studies about knowledge
        production within critical political ecology. This article is a study of the
        use of photographs in scientific articles on dryland ecology, and investigates
        the functions of photographs. Contrary to the straightforward manner in which
        they are presented, photographs are not value-free documentary proofs of ''how
        things are.'' Rather, photographs constitute arguments in their own right.
        Using photographic and textual theory, this study analyzes two articles that
        include photographs of fence-line contrasts between two different management
        regimes. Contrasting areas divided by a fence-line is a methodology that demonstrates
        how management differences lead to differences in vegetation. In a Southern
        African context, however, differences across a fence tend to encompass deep
        racial and economic divides, and the fence-line photos risk encompassing these
        differences. This article argues that the fence-line contrast photographs
        in this study function as models that order the causal links between vegetation
        dynamics, land tenure and land management. These models correspond closely
        to equilibrium models in range ecology, and the fence-line photographs thus
        contribute to a degradation narrative that has been influential for land reform
        policies in Southern Africa, and that feeds into land use policies that favor
        private land ownership in communal areas.Keywords: Critical political ecology,

        waste is the loss of perfectly edible food products. It is a wide-ranging

        research (TDR) is widely regarded as a promising, and even essential, means
        of addressing complex sustainability problems, whilst delivering beneficial
        outcomes for scientists and the non-academic actors with whom they engage.
        Premised on the ''ecological modernisation'' of Europe, regional funding for
        TDR under Framework Programmes such as FP7 and more recently Horizon 2020
        have sought to support academic engagement with a wide range of research stakeholders
        through calls for transdisciplinary research \u00a0in order to better address
        Europe''s \"grand societal challenges\" (EC 2013). This article, based on
        doctoral research, consists of an ex-post study of three European Union funded
        transdisciplinary projects (CREPE, EJOLT and GAP2) implemented under the Seventh
        Framework''s (2007-2013) Science in Society program. Its focus is on how issues
        of power and governance permeate TDR projects, giving rise to tensions, challenges
        and ultimately struggles over the very meaning of official projects and their
        outcomes, despite the most egalitarian of intentions and underlying principles
        of mutual benefit. These tensions, this article argues, should be understood
        not merely as cultural, methodological or cognitive challenges, but as essentially
        political conflicts that manifest and flow across multiple scales. In light
        of these inherent challenges, the article argues that TDR is always conducted
        on a terrain of political ecology, and concludes by making recommendations
        for potential collaborators, as well as for European research policy makers,
        with the objective of enabling participants and funders alike to realise the
        transformative potential of this promising mode of research.Keywords: Political

        ecology has expanded in multiple new directions since Piers Blaikie''s explanation
        of the manifestations of political economy and ecology in the \"problem\"
        of soil erosion in the 1980s. In this article, I try to extend political ecology
        to engage with ethnic studies literature on coloniality, and indigenous perspectives
        on intergenerational trauma and healing. Drawing on historic and contemporary
        examples of Maidu governance and resource development in the Maidu homeland,
        California, USA, I extend the concept of intergenerational trauma in Native
        American communities from the individual and ethnic group levels to include
        the community''s relationship with the land, and the concept of itself as
        a sovereign civic, governing body. I place specific manifestations of trauma,
        de-colonizing, and healing, as exemplified by Maidu natural resource activism,
        in dialogue with political ecology approaches to better understand the relationships
        between historically colonized people, governance, and land. I argue that
        the relationships between people and resources that political ecology focuses
        on cannot be adequately understood in historically colonized communities dealing
        with neo-colonial resource and political policies, without attention to perspectives
        on coloniality\/de-coloniality, and trauma\/healing. These perspectives come
        from both survivors of colonialism, and from ethnic studies and indigeneity
        scholars.Key words: political ecology, coloniality, Maidu, trauma, healing,

        relationships involving species richness may be unimodal, monotonically increasing,
        monotonically decreasing, bimodal, multimodal, U-shaped, or with no discernable
        pattern. The unimodal relationships are the most interesting because they
        suggest dynamic, nonequilibrium community processes. For that reason, they
        are also contentious. In this paper, we provide a wide-ranging review of the
        literature on unimodal (humpbacked) species richness-relationships. Though
        not as widespread as previously thought, unimodal patterns of species richness
        are often associated with disturbance, predation and herbivory, productivity,
        spatial heterogeneity, environmental gradients, time, and latitude. These
        unimodal patterns are contingent on organism and environment; we examine unimodal
        species richness-curves involving plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, plankton,
        and microbes in marine, lacustrine, and terrestrial habitats. A goal of future
        research is to understand the contingent patterns and the complex, interacting
        processes that generate them.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2011\/868426","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,8,24]],"date-time":"2011-08-24T19:00:52Z","timestamp":1314212452000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":28,"title":["The

        general diversity pattern of the Caribbean anole radiation has been described
        in detail; however, the actual mechanisms at the origin of their diversification
        remain controversial. In particular, the role of ecological speciation, and
        the relative importance of divergence in allopatry and in parapatry, is debated.
        We describe the genetic structure of anole populations across lineage contact
        zones and ecotones to investigate the effect of allopatric divergence, natural
        selection, and the combination of both factors on population differentiation.
        Allopatric divergence had no significant impact on differentiation across
        the lineage boundary, while a clear bimodality in genetic and morphological
        characters was observed across an ecotone within a single lineage. Critically,
        the strongest differentiation was observed when allopatry and ecology act
        together, leading to a sharp reduction in gene flow between two lineages inhabiting
        different habitats. We suggest that, for Caribbean anoles to reach full speciation,
        a synergistic combination of several historical and ecological factors may
        be requisite.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2012\/273413","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,2,8]],"date-time":"2012-02-08T21:01:18Z","timestamp":1328734878000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Synergy

        damage during warfare is generally accepted as an unavoidable form of collateral
        damage. Military operations should be included in discussions of environmental
        conservation. The subdiscipline warfare ecology was recently proposed to integrate
        such discussion. However, environmental damage may also be caused by peacetime
        military operations, and, in such cases, relevant stakeholders may not realize
        that warfare ecology has relevance for peacetime environmental disaster. This
        comment proposes that the epithet warfare ecology does little to attract the
        participation of the groups affected by military operations, however the term
        \u2018military ecology\u2019 would also patently include peacetime military
        activities and may thus enhance engagement. Military ecology embraces all
        environmental conservation issues related to military activity during peacetime,
        preparation for war, warfare and post-war restoration operations. The established
        term warfare ecology could be subsumed within military ecology, by accurately
        constricting its application to ecological issues directly tied to armed conflict.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0376892913000179","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,9]],"date-time":"2013-05-09T09:13:36Z","timestamp":1368090816000},"page":"207-208","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Military

#' @title Fulltext search and retrieval of scholarly texts.
#'
#' @description fulltext is a single interface to many sources of scholarly
#' texts. In practice, this means only ones that are legally useable. We will
#' support sources that require authentication on a case by case basis - that
#' is, if more than just a few people will use it, and it's not too
#' burdensome to include, then we can include that source.
#' 
#' @section Manual:
#' See <https://ropenscilabs.github.io/fulltext-book/> for a longer form
#' manual for using \pkg{fulltext}.
#'
#' @section What's included:
#' We currently include support for search and full text retrieval for a variety
#' of publishers. See [ft_search()] for what we include for search,
#' and  [ft_get()] for what we include for full text retrieval.
#'
#' @section Use cases:
#' The following are tasks/use cases supported:
#' 
#' - search - [ft_search()]
#' - get texts - [ft_get()]
#' - get full text links - [ft_links()]
#' - get abstracts - [ft_abstract()]
#' - extract text from pdfs - [ft_extract()]
#' - serialize to different data formats - [ft_serialize()]
#' - extract certain article sections (e.g., authors) - moved to \pkg{pubchunks}
#'
#' @section DOI delays:
#' Beware that DOIs are not searchable via Crossref/Entrez immediately. The
#' delay may be as much as a few days, though should be less than a day. This
#' delay should become shorter as services improve. The point of this is that
#' you man not find a match for a relatively new DOI (e.g., for an article
#' published the same day). We've tried to account for this for some publishers.
#' For example, for Crossref we search Crossref for a match for a DOI, and if
#' none is found we attempt to retrieve the full text from the publisher
#' directly.
#' 
#' @section Rate limits:
#' **Scopus**: 20,000 per 7 days. See 
#' <https://dev.elsevier.com/api_key_settings.html> for rate 
#' limit information. To see what your personal rate limit details are, 
#' request verbose HTTP request output - this will vary on the function
#' you are using - see the docs for the function. See the response 
#' headers `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and 
#' `X-RateLimit-Reset` (your limit, those requests remaining, and UTC 
#' date/time it will reset)
#' 
#' **Microsoft**: 10,000 per month, and 1 per second. There are no rate 
#' limit headers, sorry :(
#' 
#' **PLOS**: There are no known rate limits for PLOS, though if you do 
#' hit something let us know.
#' 
#' **Crossref**: From time to time Crossref needs to impose rate limits 
#' to ensure that the free API is usable by all. Any rate limits that are in 
#' effect will be advertised in the `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` and
#' `X-Rate-Limit-Interval` HTTP headers. This boils down to: they allow X 
#' number of requests per some time period. The numbers can change so we 
#' can't give a rate limit that will always be in effect. If you're curious 
#' pass in `verbose = TRUE` to your function call, and you'll get headers 
#' that will display these rate limits. See also **Authentication**.
#' 
#' @section Authentication:
#' 
#' **BMC**: BMC is integrated into Springer Publishers now, 
#' and that API requires an API key.  Get your key by signing up at 
#' https://dev.springer.com/, then you'll get a key. Pass the key to a 
#' named parameter `key` to `bmcopts`. Or, save your key in your `.Renviron` 
#' file as `SPRINGER_KEY`, and we'll read it in for you, and you don't 
#' have to pass in anything.
#' 
#' **Scopus**: Scopus requires two things: an API key and your institution must
#' have access. For the API key, go to https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html, 
#' register for an account, then when you're in your account, create an API key. 
#' Pass in as variable `key` to `scopusopts`, or store your key under the name 
#' `ELSEVIER_SCOPUS_KEY` as an environment variable in `.Renviron`, and 
#' we'll read it in for you. See [Startup] for help. For the institution access
#' go to a browser and see if you have access to the journal(s) you want. 
#' If you don't have access in a browser you probably won't have access via 
#' this package. If you aren't physically at your institution you will likely 
#' need to be on a VPN or similar so that your IP address is in the range 
#' that the two publishers are accepting for that institution.
#' 
#' **ScienceDirect**: Elsevier ScienceDirect requires two things: an API key 
#' and your institution must have access. For the API key, 
#' go to https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html, 
#' register for an account, then when you're in your account, create an API key 
#' that is allowed to access the TDM API (must accept their TDM policy). 
#' Pass in as variable `key` to `sciencedirectopts`, or store your key under the name 
#' `ELSEVIER_TDM_KEY` as an environment variable in `.Renviron`, and 
#' we'll read it in for you. See [Startup] for help. For the institution access
#' go to a browser and see if you have access to the journal(s) you want. 
#' If you don't have access in a browser you probably won't have access via 
#' this package. If you aren't physically at your institution you will likely 
#' need to be on a VPN or similar so that your IP address is in the range 
#' that the publisher is accepting for that institution.
#'  
#' **Microsoft**: Get a key by creating an Azure account at 
#' <https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions>, 
#' then requesting a key for **Academic Knowledge API** within 
#' **Cognitive Services**. Store it as an environment variable in your 
#' `.Renviron` file - see [Startup] for help. Pass your 
#' API key into `maopts` as a named element in a list like 
#' `list(key = Sys.getenv('MICROSOFT_ACADEMIC_KEY'))`
#' 
#' **Crossref**: Crossref encourages requests with contact information 
#' (an email address) and will forward you to a dedicated API cluster 
#' for improved performance when you share your email address with them.
#' https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#good-manners--more-reliable-service
#' To pass your email address to Crossref via this client, store it 
#' as an environment variable in `.Renviron` like 
#' `crossref_email = name@example.com`
#' 
#' **Crossref TDM**: TDM = "Text and Data Mining". This applies to the few 
#' publishers - Wiley and Elsevier - that are part of this program (TDM). 
#' When using [ft_get()], and you want to get papers from these two publishers,
#' you'll need two things: 
#' (1) an API key for the Crossref TDM. Go to 
#' https://apps.crossref.org/clickthrough/researchers and you'll be asked to 
#' login with your ORCID. If you don't have an ORCID go to https://orcid.org/
#' and get one. After logging in with your ORCID, click on the "API token" 
#' tag and grab your API key. Put your API key in `.Renviron` file or similar
#' (e.g. `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`, etc.) with the entry 
#' `CROSSREF_TDM=yourkey`. We'll look for the environment variable CROSSREF_TDM
#' within this package. See http://tdmsupport.crossref.org/ for more 
#' information on the Crossref TDM program.
#' (2) Your institution needs to have access to the journal you're requesting
#' papers from. If you're not sure about this just go to a browser and see if you
#' have access to the journal(s) you want. If you don't have access in a browser 
#' you probably won't have access via this package. If you aren't physically at 
#' your institution you will likely need to be on a VPN or similar so that 
#' your IP address is in the range that the two publishers are accepting for 
#' that institution. Also talk to your librarian if you aren't sure about 
#' access or have questions about it. In some cases, you may also need to request
#' that Elsevier removes a "fence" for your institution - that is, your institution
#' has access to XYZ journal(s), but they don't yet allow programmatic access. 
#' This has happened at least a few times that I know of.
#' 
#' **Entrez**: NCBI limits users to making only 3 requests per second. But, users 
#' who register for an API key are able to make up to ten requests per second. 
#' Getting a key is simple; register for a "my ncbi" account then click on a 
#' button in the account settings page. Once you have an API key, you can pass it 
#' as the argument `api_key` to `entrezopts` in both [ft_get()] and [ft_search()]. 
#' However, we advise you use environment variables instead as they are more secure.
#' To do that you can set an environment variable for the current R session like 
#' `Sys.setenv(ENTREZ_KEY="yourkey")` OR better yet set it in your `.Renviron` 
#' or equivalent file with an entry like `ENTREZ_KEY=yourkey` so that it is 
#' used across R sessions.
#' 
#' No authentication needed for **PLOS**, **eLife**, **arxiv**, **biorxiv**, 
#' **Euro PMC**
#' 
#' Let us know if you run into trouble with authentication.

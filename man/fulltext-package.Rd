\title{Fulltext search and retrieval of scholarly texts.}
\description{
fulltext is a single interface to many sources of scholarly
texts. In practice, this means only ones that are legally useable. We will
support sources that require authentication on a case by case basis - that
is, if more than just a few people will use it, and it's not too
burdensome to include, then we can include that source.
}
\section{Manual}{

See https://books.ropensci.org/fulltext/ for a longer form
manual for using \pkg{fulltext}.
}

\section{What's included}{

We currently include support for search and full text retrieval for a variety
of publishers. See \code{\link[=ft_search]{ft_search()}} for what we include for search,
and  \code{\link[=ft_get]{ft_get()}} for what we include for full text retrieval.
}

\section{Use cases}{

The following are tasks/use cases supported:
\itemize{
\item search - \code{\link[=ft_search]{ft_search()}}
\item get texts - \code{\link[=ft_get]{ft_get()}}
\item get full text links - \code{\link[=ft_links]{ft_links()}}
\item get abstracts - \code{\link[=ft_abstract]{ft_abstract()}}
\item extract text from pdfs - \code{\link[=ft_extract]{ft_extract()}}
\item serialize to different data formats - \code{\link[=ft_serialize]{ft_serialize()}}
\item extract certain article sections (e.g., authors) - moved to \pkg{pubchunks}
}
}

\section{DOI delays}{

Beware that DOIs are not searchable via Crossref/Entrez immediately. The
delay may be as much as a few days, though should be less than a day. This
delay should become shorter as services improve. The point of this is that
you man not find a match for a relatively new DOI (e.g., for an article
published the same day). We've tried to account for this for some publishers.
For example, for Crossref we search Crossref for a match for a DOI, and if
none is found we attempt to retrieve the full text from the publisher
directly.
}

\section{Rate limits}{

\strong{Scopus}: 20,000 per 7 days. See
https://dev.elsevier.com/api_key_settings.html for rate
limit information. To see what your personal rate limit details are,
request verbose HTTP request output - this will vary on the function
you are using - see the docs for the function. See the response
headers \code{X-RateLimit-Limit}, \code{X-RateLimit-Remaining}, and
\code{X-RateLimit-Reset} (your limit, those requests remaining, and UTC
date/time it will reset)

\strong{Microsoft}: 10,000 per month, and 1 per second. There are no rate
limit headers, sorry :(

\strong{PLOS}: There are no known rate limits for PLOS, though if you do
hit something let us know.

\strong{Crossref}: From time to time Crossref needs to impose rate limits
to ensure that the free API is usable by all. Any rate limits that are in
effect will be advertised in the \code{X-Rate-Limit-Limit} and
\code{X-Rate-Limit-Interval} HTTP headers. This boils down to: they allow X
number of requests per some time period. The numbers can change so we
can't give a rate limit that will always be in effect. If you're curious
pass in \code{verbose = TRUE} to your function call, and you'll get headers
that will display these rate limits. See also \strong{Authentication}.

\strong{Semantic Scholar}: Not documented in their docs, and no response
headers given. At time of this writing (2020-07-01) the rate limit is:
100 requests per 5-minutes per IP address. or 20 requests per min. Note
that this rate limit may change.
}

\section{Authentication}{


\strong{BMC}: BMC is integrated into Springer Publishers now,
and that API requires an API key.  Get your key by signing up at
https://dev.springer.com/, then you'll get a key. Pass the key to a
named parameter \code{key} to \code{bmcopts}. Or, save your key in your \code{.Renviron}
file as \code{SPRINGER_KEY}, and we'll read it in for you, and you don't
have to pass in anything.

\strong{Scopus}: Scopus requires two things: an API key and your institution must
have access. For the API key, go to https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html,
register for an account, then when you're in your account, create an API key.
Pass in as variable \code{key} to \code{scopusopts}, or store your key under the name
\code{ELSEVIER_SCOPUS_KEY} as an environment variable in \code{.Renviron}, and
we'll read it in for you. See \link{Startup} for help. For the institution access
go to a browser and see if you have access to the journal(s) you want.
If you don't have access in a browser you probably won't have access via
this package. If you aren't physically at your institution you will likely
need to be on a VPN or similar and eventually require correct proxy settings,
so that your IP address is in the range
that the two publishers are accepting for that institution.
It might be, that the API access seems to work even while
in the wrong IP range or have wrong proxy settings,
but you are not able to see the abstracts, they will be empty.
By using the currect curl options into the calls to ft_search or ft_abstracts even
the most complex proxy including authentication should work. As an example:

\preformatted{
opts <- list(key="your-scopus-key")
ft_abstract(x = dois, from = "scopus", scopusopts = opts,
  proxy="proxy-ip-address",
  proxyport=your-proxy-port,
  proxyuserpwd="username:password", # often the same as your windows login
  proxyauth=8) # ntlm - authentication
}

\strong{Elsevier/ScienceDirect}: Elsevier ScienceDirect requires two things: an
API key and your institution must have access. For the API key,
go to https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html,
register for an account, then when you're in your account, create an API key
that is allowed to access the TDM API (must accept their TDM policy).
Pass in as variable \code{key} to \code{elsevieropts}/\code{sciencedirectopts}, or store
your key under the name \code{ELSEVIER_TDM_KEY} as an environment variable in
\code{.Renviron}, and we'll read it in for you. See \link{Startup} for help. For
the institution access
go to a browser and see if you have access to the journal(s) you want.
If you don't have access in a browser you probably won't have access via
this package. If you aren't physically at your institution you will likely
need to be on a VPN or similar so that your IP address is in the range
that the publisher is accepting for that institution.

\strong{Wiley}: Replacing Crossref TDM service as of February 2021, Wiley
now requires you get a Wiley TDM key. Get one at
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/library-info/resources/text-and-datamining
Pass in as variable \code{key} to \code{wileyopts}, or preferably store
your key under the name \code{WILEY_TDM_KEY} as an environment variable in
\code{.Renviron}, and we'll read it in for you. See \link{Startup} for help. Some
notes about Wiley's TDM service:
\itemize{
\item They always respond initially with a redirect to a server dedicated to
the serving of binary resources - fulltext takes care of this
\item Wiley uses rate-limiting: no more than 3 requests per second. you
may get 429 errors if making too requests too rapidly
}

\strong{Microsoft}: Get a key by creating an Azure account
then request a key for \strong{Academic Knowledge API} within
\strong{Cognitive Services}. Store it as an environment variable in your
\code{.Renviron} file - see \link{Startup} for help. Pass your
API key into \code{maopts} as a named element in a list like
\code{list(key = Sys.getenv('MICROSOFT_ACADEMIC_KEY'))}

\strong{Crossref}: Crossref encourages requests with contact information
(an email address) and will forward you to a dedicated API cluster
for improved performance when you share your email address with them. This
is called the "Polite Pool".
https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#good-manners--more-reliable-service
To pass your email address to Crossref via this client, store it
as an environment variable in \code{.Renviron} like
\code{crossref_email=name@example.com}, or \code{CROSSREF_EMAIL=name@example.com}.
Save the file and restart your R session. To stop sharing your email when
using rcrossref simply delete it from your \code{.Renviron} file OR to temporarily
not use your email unset it for the session
like \code{Sys.unsetenv('crossref_email')}. To be sure your in the polite pool
use curl verbose by e.g., \code{ft_cr_links(doi = "10.5555/515151", verbose = TRUE)}

\strong{Crossref TDM}: TDM = "Text and Data Mining". This used to apply to just
two publishers - Wiley and Elsevier - This service officially shut down at
the end of 2020. For Elsevier, see the
"Elsevier/ScienceDirect" section above. For Wiley, see the "Wiley" section
above.

\strong{Entrez}: NCBI limits users to making only 3 requests per second. But, users
who register for an API key are able to make up to ten requests per second.
Getting a key is simple; register for a "my ncbi" account then click on a
button in the account settings page. Once you have an API key, you can pass it
as the argument \code{api_key} to \code{entrezopts} in both \code{\link[=ft_get]{ft_get()}} and \code{\link[=ft_search]{ft_search()}}.
However, we advise you use environment variables instead as they are more secure.
To do that you can set an environment variable for the current R session like
\code{Sys.setenv(ENTREZ_KEY="yourkey")} OR better yet set it in your \code{.Renviron}
or equivalent file with an entry like \code{ENTREZ_KEY=yourkey} so that it is
used across R sessions.

No authentication needed for \strong{PLOS}, \strong{eLife}, \strong{arxiv}, \strong{biorxiv},
\strong{Euro PMC}

Open an issue if you run into trouble with authentication.
